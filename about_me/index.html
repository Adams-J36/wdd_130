    <p>Let me introduce myself. I am from a town called Evanston, Wyoming. 
        I come from a small family. It is just me, my parents and my younger
        brother. My father works for a telephone company in wyoming as the head trainer.
        My mother has her own website design buisness. She was very excited to hear that
        I was taking this class. Finally, my brother is currently serving in the national guard.
        He is also attending Utah State University and is studying mechanical engineering.

    <p> This is my final semester here at BYUI. I am stidying accounting. I hope to 
        one day be a Certified Public Accountant. I had a great oppurtunity to do an internship
        at a CPA firm in Wyoming. It helped comfirmed that public accounting is what I want 
        to do for my career.
